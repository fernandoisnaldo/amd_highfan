Service that increases GPU fan speed, when it detects temperature close to critical, was created especially for a reference model Vega 56, running on a Debian operating system with amdgpu driver.

This program is exempt from warranty and I am not responsible for its use by third parties, since it was created specifically for my environment and needs.
